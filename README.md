# Hey! I'm Suriya R S 👋

Electrical Engineering grad with a minor in Math. Currently neck-deep in deep learning research and loving every bit of it.

## What I'm into

I work on ML problems that actually matter - think deepfake detection, student engagement analysis, processing astronomical images, that sort of thing. My toolkit revolves around PyTorch, and I spend way too much time tweaking model architectures and debugging CUDA errors.

Right now I'm focused on:
- Multimodal learning and synthetic data generation
- Building AI systems for education, security, and scientific research
- Contributing to open-source ML projects whenever I can

## Stuff I work with

**Languages:** Python, C++  
**Frameworks:** PyTorch, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib  
**Interests:** Computer Vision, Representation Learning, AI for Science

## What gets me excited

Research projects where ML meets real problems. Whether it's analyzing galaxy images or building better deepfake detectors, I'm all in if it pushes the boundaries of what's possible.

When I'm not training models, you'll probably find me on Codeforces grinding competitive programming problems (handle: BlackMamba08).
